      <h1>The Original Series</h1>
      <p>The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule.[56] Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which were intended to teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science.[56] This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.[56]</p>
      <p>However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the "historicals", which were not popular with the production team,[56] were dropped after <em>The Highlanders</em> (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: <em>Black Orchid</em> set in 1920s England.[57]</p>
      <p>The early stories were serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes.[58] Following <em>The Gunfighters</em> (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers.</p>

      <h1>William Hartnell</h1>
      <p><strong>William Henry Hartnell</strong> (8 January 1908 – 23 April 1975) was an English actor. Hartnell played <a href="../characters/the-first-doctor.html">the first incarnation of the Doctor</a> in <em>Doctor Who</em>, from 1963 to 1966.</p>
      <p>According to some of his colleagues on <em>Doctor Who</em>, he could be a difficult person to work with. Others, though, such as actors Peter Purves and William Russell, and producer Verity Lambert, spoke glowingly of him after more than forty years. Among the more caustic accounts, Nicholas Courtney, in his audio memoirs, recalled that during the recording of <em>The Daleks' Master Plan</em>, Hartnell mentioned that an extra on the set was Jewish, Courtney's inference being that Hartnell was slightly prejudiced. In an interview in 2008, Courtney claimed that Hartnell "was quite nationalist-minded, a bit intolerant of other races, I think."[14]However, he always got on extremely well with his first companion, played by Carole Ann Ford, who is Jewish.[15]</p>
      <p>Hartnell's deteriorating health (he suffered from arteriosclerosis, which began to affect his ability to say his lines), as well as poor relations with the new production team on the series after the departure of Verity Lambert, ultimately led him to leave <em>Doctor Who</em> in 1966.[13][16]</p>
      <p>When he left <em>Doctor Who</em>, the producer of the show came up with a unique idea: since the Doctor is an alien, he can transform himself physically, thereby renewing himself. William Hartnell himself suggested thatPatrick Troughton should be cast as the new Doctor, stating that "There's only one man in England who can take over, and that's Patrick Troughton".[17] In the fourth episode of the serial <em>The Tenth Planet</em>, the First Doctor regenerated into Troughton's <a href="../characters/the-second-doctor.html">Second Doctor.</a>[18]</p>

      <p>Thousands of years in the past a being called Light launched a survey expedition to catalogue all forms on the planet Earth. <strong>Josiah Samuel Smith</strong> was a member of the crew of Light's ship and mutinied against Light after he went into hibernation, thinking his catalogue complete. In the early 1880s, the ship had settled in the basement of a house named Gabriel Chase in Perivale Village, London. Smith began to evolve towards a human form, discarding husks of previous insect-like bodies. He had taken over the house by 1881, brainwashing its mistress, Lady Pritchard, as well as her daughter Gwendolyne, who killed her own father, Sir George Pritchard, under Smith's influence. Appearing to be strongly adept in genetics and science, as well as hypnosis, he created his own catalogue of creatures in suspended animation, including a hapless police inspector sent to investigate the Pritchards' disappearance – these specimens would awaken following the events set in motion by the arrival of the Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace in 1883.</p>
      <p>Seeking to evolve into the era's dominant form, a highborn Victorian gentleman, Smith planned to seize power in the British Empire by assassinating Queen Victoria, having kidnapped famed explorer Redvers Fenn-Cooper to gain access via his association with her. He used the house to establish some social standing and drew further attention to himself in society by espousing heretical-seeming evolutionary theories, devolving the reverend sent from Oxford to silence him into an ape. His plans were thwarted when Light was reawakened from his slumber, and another member of the survey team's crew known as Control escaped Smith's imprisonment. When Light was defeated by the Doctor, Control, who had evolved into a human lady, departed in Light's ship, taking Smith with her as a prisoner, replacing her as the survey's non-evolving control agent.</p>
